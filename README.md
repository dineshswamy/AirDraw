Wondering what it is ? The name has the clue ;) 

This app we did  at  **DROIDCON 2013 hackathon** and luckily ,winning a second place(Samsung galaxy tab 3 :) ) .
Really quickly , lets see what the app does . 

This app is  based on **sony smartwatch 2** . So , you wear the watch , you connect it to your device(tab or a phone) and then you 
draw something in the air , lets say its a square . That square will appear in your device.

You draw anything in the air , wearing that sony smartwatch , it will appear in your device . cool , isnt it ? .

We started this with high hopes , we didnt reach the bar we ve set .

I ll update the wiki page soon .**Feel free to hack it** .
